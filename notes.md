# TODO

-   tidy HTML
-   does difference between Pandoc'ed (html+raw_html) and raw HTML make sense?
    maybe just Markdown vs tidied HTML â†’ tidying becomes conversion.

-   delete / backup previous files
    function to restore previous version

-   styling via inlining?
    configure style per host?
    see https://premailer.io/, https://github.com/Automattic/juice
    remove (redundant) styles upon conversion. or all, just keep classes
    ```python
    from lxml import html
    tree = html.fromstring(html_content)
    for el in tree.iter():
    if 'style' in el.attrib:
        del el.attrib['style']
    ```
    also useful for following

-   implement in python
    ```js
    const html = editor.innerHTML
      .replace(/\s+data-mce-[^\s=]+="[^"]*"/g, "")
      .replace(/<!-- start raw html -->/g, "<script>")
      .replace(/<!-- stop raw html -->/g, "</script>");
    ```
